# LSTM-NN-for-trading-
An AI model that is trained to trade on any cryptocurrency daily. Built on the LSTM architecture and tuned with variable metrics.
The neural network architecture used was a type of recurrent neural network, the long short term memory model. It's a good model to track and predict future stock prices depending on previous ones along with other metrics tuned by the user to make it work better under different circomstances. Some of the other relevant metrics were MA20 to MA5, Market cap and others depending on frequency and crypto that is traded.
